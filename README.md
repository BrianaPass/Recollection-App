## Description
Our project's goal is to create an application that enables users to share their memories on a public platform. A user can interact with other users by liking their posts once they have been made on the platform.

## Installation
To use this app, first clone it to your local machine. Next open your command line in the application's root terminal and run `npm-install` to install necessary dependencies. Once installed, run `npm run start:dev` in the same directory to start the application.

## Usage
Once started, open a browser and go to localport 3001. The application will be started there.
